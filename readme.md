## cyberdrop-dl_looper

- Update the config.yaml with your preferences. (we're using what I found most convenient.)
- Run looper.bat

```
Do not edit these lines unless you modify the included .py files to accomodate.

input_file: urls.txt
output_last_forum_post_file: latest_forum_post.txt
```

On my list of things to do

- [ ] Create a looper.py for that use case.
- [ ] Create a looper.ps1 for that use case.


*Not sure if this works as-is. I've modified some stuff to remove anything identifying from my files.*

*I still need to test the public release.*
